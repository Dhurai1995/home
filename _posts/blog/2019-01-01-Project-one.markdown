    <p> A quasi-steady-state lap time simulation software that was implemented in MATLAB. It can be used to evaluate the effect of various vehicle parameters on lap time and performance.</p>
    <p> The model uses a linear two-track model with Magic formula tire model and takes into account aero downforce and drag, tire friction, and the engine torque curve.</p>
    <p> The peak velocities are calculated based on tire potential, powertrain data and track characteristics at each segment points. The breaking point was calculated by finding the maximum entry velocity for a turn and then calculating the speed in backwards in relative times based on maximum braking capability.</p>
