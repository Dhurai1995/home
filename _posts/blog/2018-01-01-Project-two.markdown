    <p>This is my second project with Machine learning and python to get myself familiarize with both these tools.</p>
    <p>In this project, I took the California Housing Prices dataset from online. This dataset was based on data from the 1990 California census. The main objective of this project is to build an ML model to predict the district housing price for an investment. So this is a typical supervised learning task. And is multiple and univariate regression problem. The performance measure that was used here is an RMSE.</p>
    <p>This project gave an overall process in machine learning. Along the way, I got learn about preparing the data for the machine learning algorithm including data cleaning, feature scaling and transformation pipelines. Then I applied different regression technique and evaluated the performance with K-fold cross-validation technique. Finally evaluated the model with the test set.</p>
